										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Transforming challenges into opportunities with expertise in network engineering, data analysis, project management, and cybersecurity</p>
									</header>
									<p>Hey there!</p>
									<p>My name is Lyn. You might’ve stumbled onto my page while looking for a candidate for a role, or maybe you saw my link on my resume, or just checking me out. Either way, welcome to my page!</p>
									<p>I’m not easy to describe. The longer you know me personally, the more you’ll be amused by who I am. I bet you wouldn’t like me if you just --- hate the world.</p>
									<p>If you are still curious about me. Read along.</p>

									<p>Combining expertise in network engineering, data analysis, project management, and cybersecurity to turn challenges into opportunities. Always learning, adapting, and inspiring teams to create a lasting impact!

										<h3>Here are my top 3 strengths:</h3>
										
										<h4>1. Idea Synthesizer</h4>
										I’m the kind of person who doesn’t just solve problems — I see them coming. I take ideas from different areas, like network engineering, project management, data analysis, and cybersecurity, and use them to come up with creative solutions before challenges arise.
										
										<h4>2. Adaptable</h4>
										With my mix of skills, I can quickly adjust to new situations. I’m always learning and staying curious — whether it’s picking up new technical skills or exploring different ways of thinking. This drive to grow helps me stay flexible and ready to tackle new challenges with fresh insights. Whether I’m working on network systems, managing projects, or analyzing data, I’m always finding better ways to do things and turning problems into opportunities.
										
										<h4>3. Strategic Executor</h4>
										What sets me apart is how I break down big problems into smaller, manageable parts and solve them step by step. I enjoy working with teams to make long-term improvements. I know how to guide others, help them try new ideas, and bring about positive change without needing to be the boss.

									<h3>Projects</h3>
									<p>Through academic projects, I developed a web application for IT asset management, analyzed employee attrition using Tableau and Power BI, designed a database for an airline reservation system, and built a predictive tool for mental health prediction. These projects equipped me with practical skills in data analysis, visualization, database design, and predictive modeling, laying a strong foundation for my transition into the field of data analytics.</p>

												<h4>Network Asset Management Web Application</h4>
												<p>In collaboration with my fellow students, we developed a comprehensive web application for managing IT assets. Implemented analytics, asset inventory, and a product solution finder. Utilized Figma, Lucid Chart, and dBdiagram.io for planning, VSC as code editor, and MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS) stack for database, frontend, and backend development. Implemented Plotly for analytics dashboard, Puppeteer for scraping, and Python-Paramiko Lib for remote access to network devices.</p>

												<h4>Employee Attrition Analytics with Tableau and Power BI</h4>
												<p>As part of an academic project, I analyzed employee attrition data using Tableau and Power BI. Utilizing a dataset comprising 1470 employee profiles, I employed data visualization techniques to identify factors influencing employee resignation and forecast attrition rates. This project equipped me with valuable skills in data analysis and visualization, laying the foundation for my journey into the field of data analytics.</p>

												<h4>Airline Reservation System Database Design</h4>
												<p>In a database design course, I led a project focused on designing a database for an airline reservation system. Collaborating with team members, I designed the database schema using the star model, incorporating entities such as booking, passenger, flight, date, time, and aircraft. By generating and analyzing 1000 records using MongoDB, we gained insights to enhance airline service planning and management.</p>

												<h4>Mental Health Prediction Analysis</h4>
												<p>In a predictive analytics course, I undertook a project aimed at developing a predictive tool for mental health practitioners. Leveraging a dataset of 2000 patient survey records, I performed data cleaning, scaling, and modeling techniques to predict future mental health crises. This project not only honed my skills in data preprocessing and modeling but also deepened my understanding of the potential applications of data analytics in healthcare.</p>
