										<h2>About Me</h2>
										<p>Once a Network Engineer, Now a Data Analyst: <br />
											Unveiling Insights and Crafting Narratives</p>
									</header>
									<p>Transitioning from a background in Network Engineering, I've uncovered a deep-seated passion for extracting insights from data. Shifting from configuring networks to deciphering data streams, I embarked on a transformative journey into Data Analytics. With each dataset, I refined my ability to translate raw numbers into actionable insights, driving strategic decision-making and effecting meaningful change through the power of data analysis.</p>
									<p>I completed my Post Baccalaureate Diploma in Computing Studies and Information Systems, specializing in Data Analytics, at Douglas College in December 2023. Throughout the program, I engaged in coursework in Operations Management and Supply Chain Planning, achieving a commendable GPA of 3.54. Prior to this, I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Mapua Institute of Technology in January 2009.</p>
									<p>Following the completion of my degree, I secured a position as a Program Specialist at a telecommunications company in my home country. Over subsequent years, I transitioned into the role of a Network Engineer, a move that significantly accelerated my career trajectory. Subsequently, I relocated to Singapore, where I was fortunate to secure a position as a Senior Network Engineer, further enriching my professional journey and providing both stability and financial security. In this capacity, I was deeply engaged in generating reports, gathering data, analyzing findings, and formulating insightful solutions to drive network enhancements. It was during this phase that I cultivated a fervor for data storytelling, enabling data-driven decision-making to flourish.</p>
									<p>Eventually, I made the pivotal decision to immigrate to Canada, where I enrolled in a data analytics program, fueled by a desire to explore fresh opportunities and perpetuate my personal and professional growth.</p>
